# Chart Recreation Project
Personal challenge to continue to flex R-based skills while finshing my disertation: goal of once a week, finding interesting data or a cool chart in media/related to current events and spending an hour attempting to recreate entirely in R without post-processing. 

R-code and data can be found within each topic folder. Attribution and sourcing links to original work can be found below.
