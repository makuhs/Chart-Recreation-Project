# Chart Recreation Project
While finishing my dissertation, I found I did not have time to put towards creativedata visualzation projects. I set up a personal challenge to continue to flex R-based viz skills: goal of once a week, finding interesting data or a cool chart in media/related to current events and attempting to recreate entirely in R without post-processing. 


## Select Recreations

Practice with gganimate package (attempt to replicate [a figure](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/151831/summer-2023-was-the-hottest-on-record) in the NASA GISS news article)
