# Chart Recreation Project
While finishing my dissertation, I found I did not have time to put towards creative data visualzation projects. I set up a personal challenge to continue to flex R-based viz skills: goal of once a week, finding interesting data or a cool chart in media/related to current events and spending an hour attempting to recreate entirely in R without post-processing. 

R-code and data can be found within each topic folder. Attribution and sourcing links to original work can be found below.
